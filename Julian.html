                <h4>Personal Information </h4>
                <p> My name is Julian Milan Szabo, I am a first year student at RMIT after completing high school at Emmanuel College. 
                    My whole family is Croatian and as a result this is the language primarily spoken at home. A big part of Croatian culture is football so I follow my teams Hajduk Split and
                    Bayern Munich religiously as well as play outdoor football for Melbourne Knights Football Club and indoor football for the RMIT Futsal Club, 
                    I also have a dog called Ginger who is half Jack Russel and half Pomeranian. An interesting fact about me is that I am the only left handed and left footed person in my family. 
                    I am interested in multiple areas of the IT industry however the main area which I am fascinated by is the field of cybersecurity. My interest in IT, I believe, has always been there as my dad has
                     been working with computers since before I was born so it was only a matter of time before I gravitated towards developing an interest in IT. Watching Mr Robot further increased my interest
                      in the field of Cyber Security as I was intrigued by the way people were able to gain unauthorised access to networks and computer systems and as a result I want to make sure 
                      this doesn't happen for the wrong reasons.</p>
                     
    <h4>Personality Tests</h4> 
                <h5>Myers-Briggs Test </h5>
                After taking the Myers-Briggs personality test, the personality type I was given was INFP. This personality type is one that is introverted and appears calm however are very driven by emotion. 
                This comes as no surprise to me as I do not generally like interacting with new people or expressing my thoughts and ideas if I do not have to. The INFP personality type tends to be introverted 
                meaning that in a team situation, someone with this personality type will definately be required to step out of their comfort zone as in a team situation they will be required to work with others 
                and input ideas.
                    <h5>Learning Type Test</h5>
                    After taking an online learning style test, the learning style I was given was kinesthetic. This learning style involves learning by carrying out physical activities and actually performing 
                    the task rather than reading or watching someone else do it.

                     <h5>Big Five Personality Test</h5> 
                    After taking the big five personality test, the trait which I most exhibited was the agreeableness trait. This aspect of the big five personality test indicates that I am someone who experiences a 
                    great deal of empathy and I enjoy placing the needs of others before my own. Once again this does not come as a surprise to me as when I play football I take more pride in providing my teammates with 
                    assists rather than scoring a goal myself
                        <h5>Beneficial Team Attributes </h5>
                        Though my personality type tends to be introverted meaning that in a team situation, I’m able to listen well and still bring forth ideas. For assigned work in a group,
                        I’m able to complete my individual task very well in sufficient manner.
