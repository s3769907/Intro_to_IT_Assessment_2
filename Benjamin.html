                <p>  <h3>Student Number: s3843112 </h3>
                    <h4>Personal Information </h4>
                                <p>My name is Benjamin but everyone calls me Ben. I was born and raised in Melbourne, Springvale in the south-east but moved to Deer Park in the west.
                                 My whole family tree originates from Vietnam, though I struggle a lot with speaking in my native tongue as I was raised to mainly speak english, thus making family gatherings such a hassle for me. 
                                 I graduated from Braybrook College and am currently attending RMIT to do a bachelors degree in Information Technology. I love to go out with friends at night to a club or to a party.
                                  On slow days, my friends and I would skate at night in the city to relax or drive to places to eat good food. At a young age, my interest in general IT was sparked by my heavy 
                                  usage of my father´s computer and laptop (to play games). Throughout highschool, I tried to always choose IT based subjects such as basic ICT, keyboarding and eventually Software Development in VCE.
                                   Outside of education, a few of my friends have knowledge on how to construct PCs, I often also watch/help them build. Specifically, my interest in IT would revolve around security and cloud computing. 
                                   Through these subject choices, I have basic knowledge of programming (c#), types of wired and wireless technology, networking, user design and behaviors. </p>
                                     
                    <h4>Personality Tests</h4> 
                                <h5>Myers-Briggs Test (ESTJ-T) </h5>
                                After taking the myers Briggs test, the personality trait that I supposedly have is ESTJ-T, also known as Executive. This means that I’m very traditional through values of honesty, 
                                dedication and dignity. I often take the leadership role to bring everyone together to either complete a task or bring everyone together in celebration through tradition and order.  
                            
                                <h5>Learning Type Test</h5>
                                    Through the learning type test, it’s clear that I am more of a visual learner, meaning that I tend to understand and gather knowledge through watching other people demonstrate or complete a task.
                                     However, I personally believe that I’m also a practical learner as well, meaning that If I physically practice with a task, then I’m able to pick up more knowledge  
                
                            <h5>Creativity Test</h5> 
                            Through the AULIVE creativity test, the chart leans towards the complexity and paradoxal area. This means that I’m able to process information very fluently and quickly in detail within my mind. 
                            Furthermore, I’m able to work with and use various types of information, even if its deemed or seems contradictory to my own opinions  
                            <h5>Beneficial Team Attributes </h5>
                                I think I would observe the team´s output and ideas, process it and develop/suggest how an idea can further be pushed into developing a more refined idea, acting as a double check on work. 
                                If there is any sort of “organisation” or leadership needed, I can use my ability to organise and put order into the team to meet certain deadlines to share files or ideas.  </p>
