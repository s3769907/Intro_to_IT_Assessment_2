                    <h4>Personal Information </h4>
                                <p>My name is Benjamin but everyone calls me Ben. I was born and raised in Melbourne, Springvale in the south-east but moved to Deer Park in the west.
                                 My whole family tree originates from Vietnam, though I struggle a lot with speaking in my native tongue as I was raised to mainly speak english, thus making family gatherings such a hassle for me. 
                                 I graduated from Braybrook College and am currently attending RMIT to do a bachelors degree in Information Technology. I love to go out with friends at night to a club or to a party.
                                  On slow days, my friends and I would skate at night in the city to relax or drive to places to eat good food. At a young age, my interest in general IT was sparked by my heavy 
                                  usage of my father´s computer and laptop (to play games). Throughout highschool, I tried to always choose IT based subjects such as basic ICT, keyboarding and eventually Software Development in VCE.
                                   Outside of education, a few of my friends have knowledge on how to construct PCs, I often also watch/help them build. Specifically, my interest in IT would revolve around security and cloud computing. 
                                   Through these subject choices, I have basic knowledge of programming (c#), types of wired and wireless technology, networking, user design and behaviors. </p>
                                     
                                   <h4>Group Process</h4> 
                                   <p>I believe that our team does work well together, works well fluently and we were easily able to communicate with each other, better than most groups I’ve been placed in. All of us agreed to finish our assigned tasks faster to have time to review and check through our work.</p>
