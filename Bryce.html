                    <h4>Personal Information </h4>
                                <p>I am Australian born; however, I am half Cambodian and half Australian. I graduated at Werribee Secondary College and now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. My hobbies include playing PC games and watching sports such as the UFC and boxing. What had bought me into having an interest in Information Technology is growing up in an era of a spike of advancement in technology. I remember having a terrible laptop and wondered why it was so slow and having the first touch iPod and being curious to how the touch display worked and how these apps were developed. </p>
                                     
                    <h4>Group processes:</h4>
                    <p>The Commies group worked extremely well in Assignment 2. We collaborated effectively and efficiently to get our allocated parts of the assignment completed. We did this by communicating frequently on our Microsoft Teams chat, as well as having our virtual call meetings to discuss what parts of the assignment needs to be completed. We kept this pace of work throughout assignment 3 as it works well for our groupâ€™s workstyle.</p>
