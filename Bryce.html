                <p>  <h3>Student Number: s384102 </h3>
                    <h4>Personal Information </h4>
                                <p>I am Australian born; however, I am half Cambodian and half Australian. 
                                    I graduated at Werribee Secondary College and am now studying a Bachelor of Information Technology. 
                                    My hobbies include playing PC games and watching sports such as the UFC and boxing. 
                                    What had brought me into having an interest in Information Technology is growing up in an era of a spike of advancement in technology. 
                                    I remember having a terrible laptop and wondered why it was so slow and having the first touch iPod and being curious to how the touch display worked and how these apps were developed.
                                     That curiosity had led me to choose RMIT. </p>
                                     
                    <h4>Personality Tests</h4> 
                        <h5>Myers-Briggs Test (ENFJ-A) </h5>
                                The Myers test states I am a team leader that loves to work in a team and collaborate. 
                                The Nature aspect of the test however I believe I am in between 50% of both thinking and feeling, and not more dominant in the feeling aspect. 
                                I do think before I react and work, but I can also make last minute decisions based on how I feel in certain situations
                            
                            <h5>Learning Type Test</h5>
                                The learning test is very accurate. I am more of a visual learner that loves to see and picture it to gain the best possible understanding
                                   
                                <h5>Big Five Personality Test</h5> 
                                        The five-personality test, I feel is also truthful as I dislike being negative the majority of the time. 
                                        The core patterns of me being dominant in being an empathic idealist is also accurate.
                                        I enjoy constantly thinking about and philosophising about how technology and other factors can impact the world today and the future.
                                           
                                        <h5> Beneficial Team Attributes</h5>
                                                 I am a natural team leader that loves to work in a team and collaborate, placing and encouraging everyone to communicate. 
                                                I believe I am in between 50% of both thinking and feeling, and not more dominant in the feeling aspect. 
                                                I do think before I react and work, but I can also make last minute decisions based on how I feel in certain situations.
