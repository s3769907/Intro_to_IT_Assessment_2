    My main role for the group was to make an html page and put all the information inside it and try to make it pleaseable.
    I very much enjoyed doing as I enjoy coding especially website and i have some former knowledge and  <a href= https://www.w3schools.com/ title = "w3schools"> 
    W3Schools</a> have helped me a lot in doing this website for the team. If I had more time, I would have incorporated javascripts in to the website.
     As a group we did not need to use the Github Repository as i worked most of the html, and more towards the i found it hard that if you make a little mistake in the files, 
     you had to delete and upload it again, it goes same with AWS as well, but i get why. I did most of codes in Visula Studio Code, which is pretty easy to use.

I believe the audit logs of github don't really reflect on our team efforts as we mainly did all of our work on google docs and mainly microsoft teams t
o put/get work together. The handling of the work was given to our 2 main team members who would upload it and we’d give/provide any more updates on tasks 
that needed to be done. To conclude, the microsoft team chat is more reflective of our efforts than github

The use of Github and Microsoft Teams allowed for an easy way to communicate and transfer work to one another. 
Although initially there were some challenges as these programs were new to me, Github and Microsoft teams became easy to use and keep track 
of all our work.

The Microsoft Teams were used more than GitHub with majority of our work uploaded and transferred there. The reason being is we communicated through teams, 
onstantly checking up on one another. Teams also allows edit online and simultaneously together, which made our work more efficient. However, the audit logs were
 managed by Julian and Milan and provided feedback when they needed something from the Commies.

I don’t believe that the GitHub audit logs reflect the teams work ethics as all of us worked on sources such as Google Docs which were easier for us to 
use as we had previous experience with them. We shared are work through teams as it made it easier for us to communicate and provide screen shots to each other 
if there was a need to and we could directly reply without having to check GitHub. Teams was also easier to access because of the mobile app.
