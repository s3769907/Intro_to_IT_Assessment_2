                <p>  <h3>Student Number: s376990 </h3>
    <h4> Personal Information</h4>
                <p> I hail from a South-Indian culture, i have lived in 4 countries Which Include Saudi Arabia, India, Northern Ireland and finally Australia. 
                    My favourite sport is Basketball, I love playing the sport. I have done the majority of the studying in Australia, completing Year 12 in 2017. 
                    I speak 2 languages including English and my native language Malayalam both fluently. I Love playing Video games in my spare time. I also love volunteering and love coordinating events. 
                    I have always loved technology and how it worked whether it is through hardware or software, in which it drew me to pursue an IT career, 
                    to be able to create something awesome and helpful to society. I have done an Associate Degree and enjoyed it very much and I wanted to go forward through theory and to learn more 
                    and when I saw an option to go to Bachelors, I took it. I chose RMIT as my uni is because i heard it is a great uni for technology study in Victoria and it's only one train ride to the City. 
                    I expect to learn more about the IT field, ethics and coding more.</p>
                     
    <h4>Personality Tests</h4> 
            <h5>Myers-Briggs Test (ISTJ) </h5>
            Introverted- Sensing-Thinking-Judging is the result that i got from the Myers-Briggs Test and after reading what they actual mean, I totally agree with the result 
            as I love staying indoors majority of the time and play video games or watch YouTube, I only look at more logic and reasonable approach than my “gut feeling”, and definitely love planning 
            stuff however the executing is very poor .

                <h5>Learning Type Test</h5>
                Through taking the learning style test, I’m majority a visual learner, meaning that I need to see others perform a task for me to understand and learn how to do something for myself.
                    <h5>Beneficial Team Attributes</h5> 
                    Through my Myers-Briggs Test, the result might not influence my team as I might not take charge but I’m able to listen to them and when needed, put my opinion into the discussions. 
                    My passive behavior benefits all as I can gather all information needed and do my own task sufficiently without any struggle.
                        <h5> Big Five Personality Tes</h5>
                        The Big five personality test gave answer of 5 factors with Score percentile.
                         Factor 1 was labeled as “Extroversion” with a score of 37/100. 
                         Factor 2 was labeled as “Emotional Stability” which is my highest score of 89/100, Factor 3 was labeled as “Agreeableness” which is a score of 35/100. 
                        Factor 4 was “Conscientiousness” which is my lowest score of 9/100 which implies that low scorers are impulsive and disorganized which is half false about me 
                        and I'm not impulsive but i am disorganized. 
                        And Lastly Factor 5 was labeled as intellect/Imagination with a score of 14/100 which indicated that people who score low 
                        tend to be traditional and conventional and I 100% disagree with this score as I am very open to experience and not very traditional.
