    <h4> Personal Information  </h4>
                <p>I finished year 12 in 2019 and am currently in my first year at RMIT enrolled in the Bachelor of IT. 
                    I enjoy playing video games and I almost always spend time on either Netflix or YouTube before going to sleep. 
                    Rugby is my favorite sport but I haven’t watched any matches in a long time. 
                    My interest in IT first began after seeing a documentary about Google headquarters on the discovery channel. 
                    As a young child, I was drawn towards the working environment and the easy-going nature of Googleplex. 
                    After having the opportunity to talk to some family friends that have been working in the IT industry I have grown an interest in cybersecurity. 
                    An interest that is also fuelled by my childhood dream to one day be an employee at Google.
                     I have been lucky enough to be employed by the NCR corporation as an agent to work on a project to remotely update the software of some of their customers. 
                     I have been enjoying this great opportunity and believe I will gain experience that'll help me when getting employed in the future.  </p>
                     
    <h4>Personality Tests</h4> 
                <h5>Myers-Briggs Test  </h5>
                The completion of the Myers Briggs type test has provided me with results showing me that I am an extraverted and assertive individual. 
                I tend to direct our mental energy intuitively and are more likely to make decisions based on feelings. However, when approaching work I would make decisions based on judgment. 
            
                <h5>Learning Type Test </h5>
                After the completion of the learning type test, it is evident that I am a tactile learner that prefers to learn by gaining hands-on experience rather than visual or auditory learning. 
                However, I can learn through those methods yet not as effectively. 

            <h5>Creativity Test</h5> 
            After the completion of the creativity test, I was able to realise that I like to follow a deliberate pathway rather than a spontaneous one.
           
            <h5>Beneficial Team Attributes </h5>
            Through my extraverted and assertive energy, I’m able to suggest new ideas spontaneously and provide the team with unique aspects on new developments.
             Teammates that have a slightly different personality wouldn’t be a problem as I would also help balance and encourage everyone in the team to work together
