                <p>  <h3> Student number: s3849552</h3>
                    <h4> Personal Information</h4>
                            <p>Both my parents were born and raised in Indonesia however I was born and raised in Australia making me first generation Australian. 
                                I speak a little bit of Indonesian and a bit more German however I am far from fluent in either. 
                                My hobbies include skating, playing video games, watching and playing various sports and watching movies and anime. 
                                It interests me as it is something I use everyday and as such I would like to learn more about it. I have been interested in IT since year 11 where I did some coding in my computing class. 
                                I found creating and making my own programs interesting and intriguing and as such decided to continue this curiosity in University.
                                 I also thought that the job security along with the pay that comes with the IT industry would be good for my future </p>
                                     
                    <h4>Personality Tests</h4> 
                                <h5>Myers-Briggs Test (ENFP-A) </h5>
                                    According to the test on 16 Personalities I am an ENFP-A type personality. 
                                    This means I am an assertive campaigner. Campaigners are free spirits, energetic, impulsive and outgoing much like Explorers. 
                                    However, Campaigners are more interested in the social and emotional connections when meeting new people as opposed to just being excited about being with people like Explorers
                            
                                        <h5>Learning Type Test</h5>
                                            According to this test I am a multimodal learner. This means I learn from a variety of sources however I am apparently mostly a visual learner. 
                                            his means I learn best through seeing how things are done. However, in some circumstances it may be more effective to teach me in a different way including aural. 
                                            This means I can learn through listening to someone talk about something.  
                
                                             <h5>Creativity Test</h5> 
                                                According to Adobes creativity type test I am an adventurer type creative person. This means I am someone who likes to learn and pick up new things with an abundance of energy. 
                                                However, this also means I find it hard to concentrate on a single thing. This makes sense I am a person who is easily distracted and likes to be impulsive.
                            
                                                 <h5> Beneficial Team Attributes</h5>
                                                    My personality type can influence my behaviour on a team as I am someone who likes to know who I am working with and may try to understand other team members' goals. 
                                                    I also will understand what they are going through and will want to help them if I am able
