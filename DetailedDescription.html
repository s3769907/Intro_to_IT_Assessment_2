                              <h3>Risk of VR SWAT</h3>
                                <p>There are risks in creating any projects. And in our VR SWAT project, we are aiming this project to help and train SWAT personnel on real life situations, 
                                  however there are still some risks in this project as well. One of the risks about this project is learning a game engine programs to work with VR and to work properly,
                                  and my estimate for learning a game engine is approximately 2-6 months. And another risk is computer powerful enough to run the VR games with multiple personnel in use.
                                    other risk to point our will be when we are testing out the program. There will be a possibility of the program not working or having some bugs that need to be cleared up 
                                      for use. However, the biggest risk during testing period will be the person who is testing the VR SWAT program. As they try on the VR to do the testing, the risks to the 
                                     person include Eye strains which leads to headaches, falling over and bumping into/walking into things, nausea/ vertigo/ motion sickness, over stimulation, panic
                                     attacks/fear, sometimes the weight of the headset can have some headache and pain all over the nose bridge area and also a risk of neck pain and back pain, and there is 
                                        a risk of seizures and if the headset is not clean there will be a risk of infection around the face, where the headset were present and prolonged use of the VR can lead 
                                        to major health problems like gorilla arm syndrome and rotator cuff injuries. However, these risks can be minimal if treated appropriately. </p>
