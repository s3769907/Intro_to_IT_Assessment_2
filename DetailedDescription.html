        <h3>Our Aim for this project</h3>
        <p></p>

            <h3> Roles </h3>
            <p></p>
                
                <h3>Scopes and Limits</h3>
                <p> Our project SWAT VR has many features that would make this a great application for law enforcement training. The main functional requirements for this project would be a hostage SWAT 
                    simulation with breaching and retrieving a hostage from different urban environments and situations. This is a prioritised function as this is the main and core purpose of this application. 
                    Having a voice and proximity chat is also vital to the application as learning call-outs and improving communication in team environments for breaching and retrieving a hostage is crucial in 
                    these scenarios. The coordinator being able to control the environments and communicate to personnel is also a feature that is vital to be in the final version as law enforcement training requires
                    acher being able to monitor and control what needs to be taught.
                                                        <br> <br>
                    Having a bomb defusal situation would have also been a good feature to be another additional situation practice for enforcement training, however developing another virtual reality bomb 
                    defusal mode would take more time and resources to develop. Depending on the amount of time is set to finish and complete the program with the associated cost available, this is most likely not
                     viable to include this in the project. Having a haptic feedback suit may not also be included in our final version of our project as creating and developing our own haptic suit specifically for
                      our software could be costly to produce. It would be a nice additive for a more immersive experience for better training but isn’t necessary to the program. This final version being optimised 
                      onto consoles may also not make it into the final version of our project. This is due to needing more time and resources to fully optimise the VR program onto consoles that may not have the 
                      graphical power to run the program. It will also need more time from us to develop our project to work with consoles, therefore it would be better to prioritise our time effectively on other 
                      functions that is crucial for our project.</p>

                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>The VR SWAT simulation is a tool to be used to simulate various operations inside of virtual reality. VR is incredibly useful as it allows for the user to simultaneously experience things that 
                        can happen in the real world without lots of spending. Tools required for it will likely be similar to that of video games, this is as that it will use similar mechanics to seem familiar to 
                        users. The software and hardware used will likely be based on these mechanics and principals while also keeping in mind a low budget.</p>
                         <h4>Software</h4>
                         <ul>
                            <li>Unreal Engine 4 or 5. Unreal Engine is a 3D creation tool, made by EPIC games creators of Fortnite, which can be used to create realistic 3D environments. 
                              This can be used to simulate operations and other situations using real people or even AI bots. This allows for there to be many varied scenarios in different locations. 
                              The reason why it may run on 4 or 5 is dependant on when the development of the application takes place and for what hardware it will run on as Unreal 5 has just been announced 
                              but is much more powerful requiring more powerful hardware to run.  </li>
                            <li> Windows 10 as an operating sysem</li>
                            </ul>
                                <h4> Hardware </h4>
                                <ul>
                                   <li>The hardware will depend on what the simulation will need to do. For larger scale operations it will require higher specifications for events with more than 1 
                                    person however for smaller operations it can run on lower, and thus cheaper specs, while still giving a thorough experience. This is because the simulation will likely 
                                    be used by smaller police units or even larger groups of militaries so being able to run on minimal specifications and being able to scale it up works better than only having 
                                    it for one or the other.</li> 
                                     </ul>
                                        <h4>PC</h4>
                                        <p>The specifications for the PC shown will be the recommended and should, there be more demanding uses of the simulation, the users will need to use higher specifications.</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Intel i5-4590 equivalent or greater. This CPU will be able to run the VR simulator for one person easily however on lower level specs</li>
                                            <li>NVIDIA GTX 970 equivalent or greater. This can run graphic the simulator efficiently and well for VR</li>
                                            <li>8gb of ram or more. This is enough power for the VR to run smoothly for a simple operation.</li>
                                            <li>HDMI 1.3 and 3x USB 3.0 plus 1x USB 2.0. These ports are required for the headset that will be used.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                            <h4>VR Equipment</h4>
                                             <p>No particular headset is specified however the accessories required will depend on the headset and will need to be change settings for within the simulation set up. While some headsets
                                                  will work with mobile the simulation requires more power and as such will be one that works with PC and not one that works with mobile</p>
                                                  <ul>
                                                      <li>Oculus Rift S. This headset is the most ideal as it allows for multiple controllers. These can be fine tuned to work with specific hardware for the simulation if needed or use the c
                                                          ontrollers that come with the Rift S</li>
                                                        <li>Oculus Touch Controllers. These come with the headset and are the default controllers. With some work and however our VR simulator will come with a variety of different “controllers” which will imitate the feel of the firearms needed for the operations. </li>
                                                        <li>Simulation Firearm Controller. Coming in a variety of shapes, they are designed to have a similar shape and similar functions as real firearms. This will likely be highly flexible on what headset is required and have its own sensors which work with multiple types of headsets.</li>
                                                  </ul>
                            
                        <h3>Testing</h3>
                        <p></p>

                            <h3>Timeframe</h3>
                            <p></p>

                              <h3>Risk of VR SWAT</h3>
                                <p>There are risks in creating any projects. And in our VR SWAT project, we are aiming this project to help and train SWAT personnel on real life situations, 
                                  however there are still some risks in this project as well. One of the risks about this project is learning a game engine programs to work with VR and to work properly,
                                  and my estimate for learning a game engine is approximately 2-6 months. And another risk is computer powerful enough to run the VR games with multiple personnel in use.
                                    other risk to point our will be when we are testing out the program. There will be a possibility of the program not working or having some bugs that need to be cleared up 
                                      for use. However, the biggest risk during testing period will be the person who is testing the VR SWAT program. As they try on the VR to do the testing, the risks to the 
                                     person include Eye strains which leads to headaches, falling over and bumping into/walking into things, nausea/ vertigo/ motion sickness, over stimulation, panic
                                     attacks/fear, sometimes the weight of the headset can have some headache and pain all over the nose bridge area and also a risk of neck pain and back pain, and there is 
                                        a risk of seizures and if the headset is not clean there will be a risk of infection around the face, where the headset were present and prolonged use of the VR can lead 
                                        to major health problems like gorilla arm syndrome and rotator cuff injuries. However, these risks can be minimal if treated appropriately. </p>
